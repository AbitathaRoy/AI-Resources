# 🔬 AI Tools for Research: 2025 Guide
*Based on "AI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool" (Nature, 2025)*

### 1. Literature Search & Discovery
*Tools that help you find relevant papers, map connections between concepts, and ensure you aren't missing key citations.*

| Tool | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ResearchRabbit** | A visual discovery tool that creates "maps" of papers. It uses a "seed paper" to find all connected work, visualizing the network of citations. | *You have one perfect paper and want to find every other paper that cites it or is cited by it.* |
| **Semantic Scholar** | An AI-enhanced search engine that filters irrelevant results better than Google Scholar. It extracts key findings and allows "semantic" queries (searching by meaning, not just keywords). | *You want to find papers that discuss "protein folding errors" even if they don't use that exact keyword in the title.* |
| **Elicit** | An "AI Research Assistant" that automates literature reviews. It can find papers, extract data from them into a table, and answer questions based solely on the papers found. | *You need to know "What is the average sample size in recent autism studies?" and want a table comparing 50 papers.* |
| **Consensus** | A search engine designed to answer "Yes/No/Maybe" scientific questions. It aggregates findings from multiple papers to give a "consensus meter" on a topic. | *You type "Does creatine improve cognitive function?" to see what percentage of studies say "Yes" vs. "No".* |
| **Scite.ai** | A citation analysis tool that categorizes citations as "supporting," "mentioning," or "contrasting." It helps you verify if a paper has been debunked or replicated. | *Checking if the key paper you are basing your thesis on has been retracted or heavily disputed by newer studies.* |

### 2. Reading & Summarization
*Tools that help you digest complex papers quickly and break down jargon.*

| Tool | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scholarcy** | An AI summarizer that turns research papers into interactive flashcards. It highlights key terms, limitations, and future work sections automatically. | *You have 50 PDFs to screen for a review and need to quickly see the "Study Limitations" of each without reading the whole text.* |
| **SciSpace (formerly Typeset)** | Allows you to upload a PDF and "chat" with it. You can highlight confusing text and ask the AI to explain it in simple language or summarize the abstract. | *You are reading a dense physics paper and don't understand a specific equation; you highlight it and ask, "Explain this in simple terms."* |
| **ChatPDF** | A simple, fast tool where you drop a PDF and start a chatbot conversation about its contents. Good for quick queries on single documents. | *Uploading a manual or protocol and asking, "What is the recommended temperature for the incubation step?"* |

### 3. Writing & Polishing
*Tools that assist with drafting, language correction, and adhering to journal guidelines.*

| Tool | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paperpal** | An AI writing assistant specifically trained on academic manuscripts. It checks for grammar, but also for academic tone, style, and concise phrasing. | *You wrote a draft that sounds too casual; Paperpal suggests changing "we looked at" to "we investigated."* |
| **Jenni AI** | An AI autocomplete writer that suggests the next sentence based on your context and citations. It can also help generate counter-arguments or transitions. | *You are stuck on the Discussion section and need a prompt to help transition from your results to the broader implications.* |
| **Writefull** | Similar to Grammarly but trained entirely on scientific papers. It offers widgets for LaTeX and Word to correct technical phrasing. | *Fixing awkward phrasing in a LaTeX document to sound more like a native English speaker in your specific field.* |
| **DeepL** | The gold standard for translation. Often cited by non-native English speakers for having more nuance than Google Translate. | *Translating your native-language draft into English before refining it with Paperpal.* |

### 4. Data Analysis & Coding
*Tools that help generate code, visualize data, or perform statistical analysis.*

| Tool | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Julius AI** | An AI data analyst that links to Excel/Google Sheets. You can ask it questions in plain English, and it performs the analysis and generates charts. | *You upload a spreadsheet of patient data and type, "Create a box plot showing the age distribution by treatment group."* |
| **GitHub Copilot** | An AI pair programmer that helps write code for data analysis (R, Python, etc.). It predicts whole blocks of code or functions. | *You are writing an R script for a heatmap but forgot the exact syntax; you type a comment explaining what you want, and Copilot writes the code.* |
| **ChatGPT (with Advanced Data Analysis)** | OpenAI's tool that can execute Python code. You can upload datasets and ask it to clean data, run statistical tests, or convert file formats. | *Uploading a messy `.csv` file and asking it to "remove all rows with missing values and convert the date column to YYYY-MM-DD."* |

### 5. Specialized / Emerging Tools
*Specific tools highlighted for niche or new use cases in 2025.*

| Tool | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRESt** | *Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientist.* A newer tool (often associated with lab automation) that helps design experimental workflows. | *Planning a complex PCR experiment where the AI suggests controls and optimal plate layouts.* |
| **Lumina** | An emerging suite (often referenced alongside new search tools) for deep interdisciplinary search, sometimes used for finding datasets rather than just papers. | *Searching for open-access datasets regarding climate change in specific geographic regions.* |
